# RemoteAdminTool
My attemp at building RAT in c# it works more or less, but it needs more work. 
I don't think it's in antyvirus databases, but it'll will be, I hope. 
It'd be so cool to be in antyvirus databases :). 
Anyway it gives you control of CMD on remote PC and some other options. 
You can start other processes and more...
